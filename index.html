 	  <h2>Fashion üë†</h2>
 	  <p>
 		 The very first thing to know about me, is that I love fashion. Every time that I am doing something related to fashion, I am the happiest as I ever been. I watch movies about fashion, I have lots of books about it, I love learning about new designers, looking at the "d√©fil√©s" during the FashionWeek. But I think the thing that I like the most, is seeing the exhibitions of great designers and seeing their art with my own eyes. As you probably understood by now, I want to work in fashion, for a huge designers or luxury brand abroad.

 	  <h2>Travels ‚úàÔ∏è</h2>
 	  <p>
 	 	 Travelling to me, is discovering new cultures, different ways of life, hearing langages that you probably don't know. It is also this feeling when you are in the airport waiting for your flight, it's sharing this moment with your family or your friends and one day say "Do you remember when we went to..". I love travelling and always be grateful to my parents for allowaing me such opportunities. I hope one day to find a job that will allow me to travel a lot. Among my many trips, I think that the ones that I loved the most were New York City, Finland, and Morocco.

  	  <h2>Italie üáÆüáπ </h2>
 	  <p>
 		 To be honest, I am not sure why I choose to talk about Italy, but, Italy is kind of my safe place. My grandmother was italian, therefore a part of my family lives in Italy and every summer I go there with my parents. To me, Italy is summer. It is a place where I will always feel great. I love everything about Italy; the people, the food, the landscape, the lifestyle, the langage. I know that some day I will buy a house in Tuscany, next to a small village, where I could listen to the italian songs that my father always listen to, and invite my friends and family there.
